## Installation
Make sure you have OpenFrameworks installed.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Copy the rawwaves folder into bin/data of the project (see the ofxStk readme, on GitHub).

3. Compile.

4. Run the program once - you may not hear any sound. If so, in the setup() method in ofApp.cpp, make sure youâ€™re selecting the right audio output device. (Running the app once will print your output devices to the console.)

5. Enjoy! 

# Acknowledgements

I used and modified the openFrameworks starter code provided by Tim and Romain to drawing and artwork, and used ofxStk. The alpha-motion-blurring technique came from a tutorial online as well.
